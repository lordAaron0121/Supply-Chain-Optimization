# Automate Budget Planning Using Linear Programming ðŸ’¹
Companies need to invest in IT capabilities, equipment or warehouse space to improve the efficiency of their operations.

## Problem Statement
Because of budget constraints, they need to decide for which projects the organization will allocate resources.

## Objective
In this project, I will design a linear programming model with Python to automate this decision-making process considering:
- return on investment of each project after 3 years
- total costs per year
- budget limits per year

## Management guidelines
- Sustainable development
- Digital transformation
- Operational excellence
