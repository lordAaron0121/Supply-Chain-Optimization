# Retail Demand using Machine Learning 🚚
Most retailers take a fixed, rule-based approach to forecast demand and replenish their order. This works well enough for stable and predictable product categories but is limited due to inventory and unoptimized replenishment. 

## Problem Statement ❓
The potential optimization can reduce operational costs by:
- inventory optimization: matching store inventory with actual needs to reduce storage space needed (rental costs)
- replenishment optimization: minimize replenishment quantity per order between warehouses and stores (warehousing & transportation costs)

## Objective 🎯
We will do feature engineering before we start the forecasting. 

## Dataset 
This notebook uses a dataset from the Kaggle challenge: [Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only)
