# CSV_to_DB_automation 📂
As a data scientist, we work with different types of data and other departments like marketing and sales. Oftentimes, we take their excel/csv file and upload it to our computer onto databases. This takes too much time, hence this project is about creating a Python script that automatically cleans a csv file and upload it to a database.

### Part 1: 
- Import a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe
- Clean the table and columns (rename table, columns, fill NULL values)
- Write SQL statements
- Connect to the MySQL database
- Insert into database

### Part 2:
- Automate the above tasks using for-loops
- Able to handle multiple files 
- Requirements ⚠️:
1. CSV files are placed in the same directory as the notebook
2. Create the database manually before running the notebook
