# Supply Chain Sustainability Reporting🌲
The demand for sustainable development from investors and customers has grown over the years. Investor have placed an increased emphasis on the sustainability of the business when assessing the value and resiliency of an organization. Therefore, more and more organizations invest resources to build capabilities for sustainability reporting and determine the best strategies for a sustainable supply chain.

## Problem Statement ❓
In this project, I will use report the CO2 emissions of your Distribution Network using Python and PowerBI.

### CO2 emissions formula for transportation 👨‍🔬
#### Definition
There are 3 scopes of greenhouse gas emissions:
1. Direct emissions: released to the atmosphere becasue of company's activities (manaufacturing plants, warehouses, vehicles)
2. Indirect emissions: Generation of purchased energy (electricity, gas, ...)
3. Other indirect emissions: Transportation, waste of operations, business travels, ...
In this project we will focus on the 3rd scopes calculations related to downstream transportation.

#### Formula to estimate the CO2 emissions of transportation
$E_{CO2} = W_{goods} * D * F_{mode}$
E_CO2: Emissions in kilograms of CO2
W_goods: weight of the goods
D: distance from warehouse to final destination
F_mode: emissions factor for each transportation mode 
> This formula provides a gross estimation of the CO2 emissions.
