# Supply Chain Sustainability Reporting🌲
The demand for sustainable development from investors and customers has grown over the years. Investor have placed an increased emphasis on the sustainability of the business when assessing the value and resiliency of an organization. Therefore, more and more organizations invest resources to build capabilities for sustainability reporting and determine the best strategies for a sustainable supply chain.

## Problem Statement ❓
In this project, I will use report the CO2 emissions of your Distribution Network using Python and Tableau.

### CO2 emissions formula for transportation 👨‍🔬
#### Definition
There are 3 scopes of greenhouse gas emissions:
1. Direct emissions: released to the atmosphere becasue of company's activities (manaufacturing plants, warehouses, vehicles)
2. Indirect emissions: Generation of purchased energy (electricity, gas, ...)
3. Other indirect emissions: Transportation, waste of operations, business travels, ...
In this project we will focus on the 3rd scopes calculations related to downstream transportation.

#### Formula to estimate the CO2 emissions of transportation

> This formula provides a gross estimation of the CO2 emissions. 

### Objective 🎯
1. Collect and process data to calculate the emissions.
2. Calculate the unit of measure conversions considering the shipped handling units.
3. Add distances by mode and compute the CO2 emissions by order.
4. Visualize using PowerBI
